            <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
            <p>Guess the CUBLE in as few tries as you can.</p>
            <p>Each guess must be a solvable cube. Status indicators for corner/edge orientation parity and permutation
                parity are provided for your convenience.</p>
            <p>Click or tap on a piece to select it. Hit ‚ùå to erase a piece, üîÑ to flip an edge or twist a corner, and ‚úÖ
                to submit.
            </p>
            <p>After each guess, a 2D projection will tell you how close your guess was to the actual scramble.</p>
            <p>A new CUBLE will be available each day!</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <canvas id="example"></canvas>
            <p>The white top left corner facelet is the correct color.</p>
            <p>The bottom left corner facelet that is /'ed out is NOT white, but there is another CORNER piece on the
                same face that is
                white.</p>
            <p>The right edge facelet that is /'ed out is NOT green, but there is another EDGE piece on the same face
                that is green.
            </p>
            <p>The rest of the colors that are X'ed out do not appear anywhere else on the white face.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Notes and Tips</h2>
            <p>To help get you started, the results of guessing the solved cube are shown first. This free guess does
                not count against your score.</p>
            <p>You can only use each piece once, so you will first have to erase one piece to change the color of
                another.</p>
            <p>To ensure the cube always stays in a solvable state, try to limit yourself to the following actions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flipping two edges</li>
                <li>Twisting three corners once</li>
                <li>Twisting one corner twice and two corners once</li>
                <li>Cycling three pieces while preserving their orientations</li>
                <li>Swapping two PAIRS of pieces while preserving their orientations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The game saves automatically after each guess and locks pieces that are correctly permuted and oriented
                in place, so you don't have to worry about accidentally messing up your progress.</p>
            <p>The numbers after the guess in the share text represent how many guesses it took to get the corresponding
                piece in the following list list correct:</p>
            <p>UF UR UB UL DF DR DB DL FR FL BR BL UFR URB UBL ULF DRF DFL DLB DBR</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Fixing an Unsolvable Cube</h2>
            <p>If edge parity (EP) is nonzero, flip any edge.</p>
            <p>If corner parity (CP) is nonzero, twist one or more corners until it reaches zero.</p>
            <p>If permutation parity (PP) is nonzero, swap any two pieces.</p>
