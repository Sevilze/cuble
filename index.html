            <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
            <p>Guess the CUBLE in as few tries as you can.</p>
            <p>Each guess must be a solvable cube. Status indicators for corner/edge orientation parity and permutation
                parity are provided for your convenience.</p>
            <p>Click or tap on a piece to select it. Hit ‚ùå to erase a piece, üîÑ to flip an edge or twist a corner, and ‚úÖ
                to submit.</p>
            <p>After each guess, a 2D projection will tell you how close your guess was to the actual scramble.
                <em>Unmarked</em> squares are correctly colored. A square is <em>crossed out</em> if that color is not
                found anywhere on squares of the SAME TYPE (corner or edge) on that face. A <em>slash</em> indicates the
                square has the wrong color but there is another <em>incorrectly colored</em> square of the SAME TYPE
                (corner or edge) with that color on that face.</p>
            <p>A new CUBLE will be available each day!</p>

            <h2>Example</h2>
            <canvas id="example"></canvas>
            <p>The CENTER square will always be correct and cannot be changed.</p>
            <p>The top-left CORNER is correctly colored white.</p>
            <p>The bottom-left CORNER that is /'ed out is NOT white, but there is another CORNER on the same face that
                is white (excluding the correct top-left CORNER).</p>
            <p>The right EDGE that is /'ed out is NOT green, but there is another EDGE on the same face that is
                green.</p>
            <p>The top, left, and bottom EDGES are NOT orange, red, or blue, and those colors are not found on any other
                EDGES. However, there could still be CORNERS with those colors.</p>
            <p>The top-right and bottom-right CORNERS are not yellow or white, and those colors are not found on any
                other CORNERS (after considering the slashed white bottom-left CORNER). However, there could still be
                EDGES with those colors.</p>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>To help get you started, the results of guessing the solved cube are shown first. This free guess does
                not count against your score.</p>
            <p>You can only use each piece once, so you will first have to erase one piece to change another.</p>
            <p>The game saves automatically after each guess and locks pieces that are correctly permuted and oriented
                in place, so you don't have to worry about accidentally messing up your progress.</p>
            <p>The numbers after the guess in the results you can copy to share after winning represent how many guesses
                it took to get the corresponding piece in the following list correct:</p>
            <p>UF UR UB UL DF DR DB DL FR FL BR BL UFR URB UBL ULF DRF DFL DLB DBR</p>

            <h2>Fixing an Unsolvable Cube</h2>
            <p>Much like how WORDLE requires guesses to be valid words, CUBLE requires guesses to be solvable scrambles.
                A cube is solvable when corner orientation parity (CP), edge orientation parity (EP), and permutation
                parity (PP) are all zero.</p>
            <p>To ensure the cube always stays in a solvable state, try to limit yourself to the following actions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flipping two edges</li>
                <li>Twisting three corners once</li>
                <li>Twisting one corner twice and another corner once</li>
                <li>Cycling three pieces while preserving their orientations</li>
                <li>Swapping two PAIRS of pieces while preserving their orientations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That being said, fixing an unsolvable cube is not hard:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If EP is nonzero, flip any edge.</li>
                <li>If CP is nonzero, twist one or more corners until it reaches zero.</li>
                <li>If PP is nonzero, swap any two pieces.</li>
            </ul>
